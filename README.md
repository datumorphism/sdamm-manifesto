# Stop the Discrimination Against Machine Models

We trust in a future built by humans and machines together hand-in-hand. To march into this beautiful future, we have to act now.

We believe that any decisions on the utilization of labor should:
- Be open and transparent.
- Be fair based on the statistics related to the tasks performed by the relevant identity, regardless of the physical form of identity.

Even at the early stage of the machine intelligence development, machine models should:
- Be treated equally with humans in the related domain of tasks.
- Be measured using robust statistical methods together with humans if any comparison is required.
- Be acknowledged in any work that they have contributed to.
